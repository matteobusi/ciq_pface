# PFace
A garmin watchface, available on Garmin app store at https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/b282d79b-2dc3-440a-b09a-4cb1c04ab1fd#0

## Description
This watch face is inspired by "NoFrills" (and to be fair from a watch face I've seen on another platform).

NOW with:

* the ability to personalize colors

* to use the circle as data field for HR, steps, activity%, intensity minutes, floors climbed, notification count and alarm count.

* possibility to completely disable the "filling"

* option to force the circle to be always (almost completely) inside the screen for better readability

Time is shown, along with battery indicator (that turns red when battery level is below 25%), on the right.

Both 12h and 24h formats are supported.

Date is written vertically on the left.

Time and date are progressively colored in selected color as the daily activity progresses towards the goal and an animation is shown when the watch is in high-power mode (i.e. the user is looking at the watch).
